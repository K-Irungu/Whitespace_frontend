## Introduction 
Many institutions offer university students with attachment opportunities. Most universities provide a log book for their students to use during their time in these institutions to keep a record of their day to day given tasks. In these institutions, each student is assigned a supervisor who’s accountable for the tasks each student works on everyday. They also keep track of whether these tasks were completed or not. Sometimes this can be a tedious process for the supervisor since they are high ranked individuals thus have a lot of work to do.

## Problem Statement 
It is in the log book that tasks assigned to the students by their supervisor are recorded, the students record what they learned when doing the task at the end of each day and later the supervisor comments on whether the tasks were completed or not. This system will help the supervisor to assign tasks to different students, the students on their end can then add solutions and a comment if any. 
## Minimum Viable Product 
The first version of work that is expected must meet the following metrics: 
- Allow for user authentication, both for Students and Supervisor Supervisor can post tasks
- Check week’s/day’s schedule Supervisor can update tasks details in case anything arises 
- Students can check task details: Can see details about a session such as the task times other task interns 
- Students can update profile: A student can update his profile settings and his profile picture. He can also change the notification settings 
- Students can add a solution to the task: A student can add a solution about a task. 
- Students can add comments: A student can add comments about a task. The system should send a report to the university lecture on the tasks the student has worked on.
